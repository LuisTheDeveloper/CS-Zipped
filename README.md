# CS-Zipped
Working with zip files.

This project was initially created to have a small DOS console application that reads how many files are inside a specific zip file and writes that number into an excell file.
This started has a .Net Core which created a .dll and not an .exe when building the solution.

Switching now to .Net Framework, named: "CS-Zipped-2"
